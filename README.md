The New DAO
A general governance framework can be adopted by many existing DAO platforms.


Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are decentralized applications running on blockchain. The difference from other Dapp is that they are virtual organizations based on the interaction of many stakeholders who do not know each other and do not trust each other. DAO governance models can be complicated because they are not under the control of a central authority. 
Many believe that DAOs hold the promise for the future of business and work, but despite a lot of discussion in the blockchain community, a successful governance system and operational basis for DAOs is still missing. The existing DAO governance models include cumbersome processes especially for decision-making, upgrading the code, and identity and permission management. They are not flexible enough to adapt to dynamically changing conditions easily and cost-effectively. 
This Project aims to fill these requirements by employing Policy Based Management and Decentralized Identity technologies.
